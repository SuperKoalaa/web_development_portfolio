## What I used

- Amplify Framework as Backend
- React.js as Frontend
- Using SCSS style pree-processoors, which can quickly write code while preventing the duplication of called properties wi the same value.
- Creat clean css with BEM methodology(BEM is a fron-end naming method foor organizing and naming CSS classes)
- Using "Framer Motion" to Open the Menu side bar, when user click the menu icon "when the screen is less than 900px". Also to animate the header, etc...
